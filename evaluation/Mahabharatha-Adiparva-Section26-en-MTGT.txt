The Saudis said, "Indra, the god-king and possessor of the best of horses in his chariot, after being thus worshiped by Kadru, obscured the sky with blue clouds.
He commanded the clouds, 'Shower your drops of holiness, not of life.'
The clouds matched the light with lightning and rained down uninterruptedly as they roared into the sky.
The sky looked like the end of the age with those clouds that were magnificent, terribly roaring, and constantly raining down huge masses of water.
The sky looked like it was going mad with the waves of rain, the roar of the clouds, the light of the lightning, the gusts of wind and the turbulence of the heavy rain.
The whole sky was obscured by clouds. The rays of the sun and the moon were completely obscured by the incessant rain.
The snakes were overjoyed as Indra rained heavily.
The earth was filled with water everywhere, and clear, cold water flowed into the abyss.
The earth was surrounded by innumerable waves of water.
